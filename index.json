    "title": "LogMessage Utility for Unity Desu | Klazapp Logger | 1.0.0",
    "keywords": "LogMessage Utility for Unity Desu Introduction The LogMessage utility class is part of the com.Klazapp.Utility namespace, designed for Unity projects to simplify logging process. It allows for an easy on/off switch to enable or disable all log messages in the app, eliminating the need to manually comment out or add log statements in each script. Features Easy toggling of log messages with a single switch. Methods for standard, error, and warning messages, each color-coded for clarity. Conditional compilation to ensure log calls are only included in builds where logging is enabled. Usage To use LogMessage, first ensure it is correctly added to your Unity project. You can then call its methods in your scripts as follows: LogMessage.Debug(\"This is a debug message\"); LogMessage.DebugError(\"This is an error message\"); LogMessage.DebugWarning(\"This is a warning message\"); To enable logging, define ENABLE_LOGS in your project's compilation symbols. When ENABLE_LOGS is not defined, calls to LogMessage methods will be ignored, reducing overhead in production builds. Installation To install the LogMessage utility via Unity's Package Manager, follow these steps: Open the Unity Package Manager: In Unity, go to Window > Package Manager. Add Package from Git URL: In the Package Manager, click the + icon at the top left corner and select Add package from git URL.... Enter the Git URL for this repository. It usually looks like https://github.com/klazapp/Unity-Logger-Public.git. Import into Your Project: Unity will resolve and download the package. Once the package is downloaded, it will be available in your project, and you can start using LogMessage in your scripts. License This utility is released under the MIT License."
